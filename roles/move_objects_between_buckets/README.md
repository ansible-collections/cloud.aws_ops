move_objects_between_buckets
==================

A role to move objects from one S3 Bucket to another.
Objects have two options: all objects can be transferred or specific objects are transferred through key prefix.
If the source bucket is empty, the user has two options: source bucket is deleted or source bucket is kept as an empty bucket.

Requirements
------------

AWS User Account with the following permission:

* s3:HeadBucket
* s3:GetBucketOwnershipControls
* s3:ListObjectsV2
* s3:ListBucket
* s3:DeleteObject
* s3:HeadObject
* s3:PutObjectAcl
* s3:CopyObject
* s3:GetObjectTagging
* s3:DeleteBucket

Role Variables
--------------

* **source_bucket**: The name of the Amazon S3 bucket that will have its objects retrieved and then emptied. **Required**
* **dest_bucket**: The name of the Amazon S3 bucket that will receive the objects. **Required**
* **key_prefix**: limits objects that begin with the specified prefix. Default value is **""**.
* **delete_empty_source_bucket**: deletes source bucket after all objects have been transferred to destination bucket. Default value is **false**.

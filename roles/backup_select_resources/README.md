backup_select_resources
==================

A role to configure backups for selected resources. The role requires an existing backup vault and plan, and adds selected resources to the provided plan. A set of variables for resource selections is included for use as-is or as examples for modification. This role can be combined with the `backup_create_plan` role to create or update a backup plan if one does not already exist. (see [example playbook](#create-backup-plan-and-select-resources)).

Requirements
------------

AWS User Account with the following permission:

* backup:CreateBackupSelection
* backup:DeleteBackupSelection
* backup:GetBackupPlan
* backup:GetBackupSelection
* backup:ListBackupSelections
* iam:GetRole

Role Variables

* **selection_name**: (Required) The display name of the resource selection you want to back up.
* **selection_resources**: (Required) List of resources selected for backup. Can use wild cards and/or combine with selection options below to precisely restrict resources based on various conditions. See included vars for examples.

* **selection_conditions**: Conditions for resources to back up
* **backup_role_name**: (Required) The name of an IAM role with permissions to perform all needed backup actions for the selected resources. Alternatively, provide a new for a new IAM role which will be created with the same permissions as the AWSBackupDefaultServiceRole (note: these permissions allow backups and restores for all resources).
